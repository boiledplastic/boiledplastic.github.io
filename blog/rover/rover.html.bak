	  <p>CAD designer and builder for mars rover, explain design process. 
Creating a prototype rover for a course wide  competition. Rover must traverse through an obstacle course, pick up objects with a claw and drill through different sediments all while competing for the fastest time. 
</p>
<p>Original design was based on a turtle shell, however after prototyping with vacuum forming I decided to switch to a more angular approach using laser cutting. </p>

      <p>This design required much more thought during the design process, but also gave specific compartments for the batter and motor carrier. </p>

	  <p> We were also required to make a suspension system to minimise the impact of a drop test. This system was made using widely available parts in the lab.</p>

	  <p>I designed a needle shape for the drill similar to precusive drills, with a rack and pinion attached to a servo motor to allow for repetitive strikes.</p>
	  <p>For maximum efficiency, we created a very simplistic claw as to not make the rover too front heavy. </p>
